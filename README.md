# ShutdownVirus
Disclaimer: The author added this to Git Hub only for study purposes. 

I found this virus on my Laptop. It was shutting down my Laptop in 5 minutes after my system was loaded. Here are all the files of this virus. Plus, I tried to reverse it. I found some interesting info. File hdwqwo contains code like "SetTimer" etc. However, I don't understand what the js script does here. Super complicated for me.


Solution if your PC turns off every five minutes:
1) Go to safe mode
2) Open task manager
3) Go to Start-up 
4) If you have Microsoft Windows Based Script Host, then disable it 
5) If you have cmd.exe in autorun also disable it.
6) Then go to properties of  Microsoft Windows Based Script Host
7) Copy the path and go to this directory
8) Delete everything there
9) ...
10) Profit
